# Slide Deck Guidelines

* Slide decks should be in the PDF format.
* Slide decks should be context-free 
    * Include the name and year of the conference somewhere in your slide deck.
    * Include links to supplemental presentation materials (example code, referenced documents, etc) in your slide deck.
* Place your copyright somewhere in your slide deck.

##Q/A:

*Why PDFs?*

* A PDF slide deck is a single file, making it easy to download and forward.
* PDFs are fairly portable and have a consistent rendering across bdesktop and mobile OSes.
* PDFs are easy to print.

*Why should we include contextual information (conference name, links, etc)? Why should we include a copyright ?*

Our audience (both conference attendees and video viewers) may redistribute our slide decks to their colleagues. Our slide decks should contain as much context as possible to inform those who receive the slides second- (or third-, or fourth-) hand.
